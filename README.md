# MusicPilot

## Description
The Music Pilot allows the music enthusiast to retrieve music videos, a list of tracks and song lyrics, from their favorite artist with a simple search. Search for the artist of your choice and click the search button to see a display of artists list, a video, and song lyrics. The application allows the user to search for various musical content with the click of a button. We collaboratively worked with the data from the MusixMatch and YouTube Iframe APIs to search and display the content of the application.
