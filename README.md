# MusicPilot

## Description
The Music Pilot allows the music enthusiast to retrieve music videos, a list of tracks and song lyrics, from their favorite artist with a simple search. Enter the artist of your choice in the search input field then click the search button to see a display of artists list, a video, and song lyrics. The application allows the user to search for various musical content with the click of a button. We collaboratively worked with the data from the MusixMatch and YouTube Iframe player APIs to search and display the content of the application. We used the local storage web API to construct a saved artist list to the application.

## Usage 
The application can be used to search for music content based on the user search input. The results display's video content with pause and play features. The artists and their top songs appear in a list that can be saved and reviewed after the page has been refreshed. Once you get the list of artists and song titles, you can use these results to search for the lyrics to an artists song. This can be accomplished by searching for the lyrics by artist and song title. The lyric results will appear on the screen if search is successful. See example of mock-up below.
