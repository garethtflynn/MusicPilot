# MusicPilot

## Description
The Music Pilot allows the music enthusiast to retrieve music videos, a list of tracks and song lyrics, from their favorite artist with a simple search. Enter the artist of your choice in the search input field then click the search button to see a display of artists list, a video, and song lyrics. The application allows the user to search for various musical content with the click of a button. We collaboratively worked with the data from the MusixMatch and YouTube Iframe player APIs to search and display the content of the application. We used the local storage web API to construct a saved artists and tracks list to the application.gi
